//In JavaScript, let is generally preferred over var for several reasons:

//Block Scope: let is block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block it is defined in (e.g., within a loop or an if statement). In contrast, var is function-scoped, which can lead to unexpected behavior if you try to use it outside the block where it was defined.

if (true) {
    let blockScoped = 'I am block scoped';
    var functionScoped = 'I am function scoped';
}
console.log(functionScoped); // 'I am function scoped'
console.log(blockScoped); // ReferenceError

//No Hoisting Issues: While both var and let are hoisted, variables declared with var are initialized with undefined, which can lead to errors if you try to use them before their declaration. With let, you cannot access the variable before its declaration, leading to a ReferenceError if you attempt to do so.

console.log(varVariable); // undefined
var varVariable = 10;

console.log(letVariable); // ReferenceError
let letVariable = 20;

//Re-declaration: Using let, you cannot declare the same variable within the same scope, which helps prevent accidental variable re-declarations that can lead to bugs. var allows re-declaration, which can introduce errors in your code.

let x = 10;
let x = 20; // SyntaxError

var y = 10;
var y = 20; // No error
Overall, let provides more predictable behavior and reduces the likelihood of bugs, making it the better choice for variable declarations in modern JavaScript.
